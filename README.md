Productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. (Project 3 of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree).

Added enhancements to two apps in order to make them production ready. The work included ensuring errors were handled gracefully, building a widget for the home screen, support for screen readers, optimizations for localization, and barcode scanning via a library.
